## Abstract

How do interactions between organisms and their environment influence the dynamics of ecological communities? Ecologists have long understood that species performance can be impacted by both their response to the abiotic variation and by their interactions with other organisms. In my dissertation I aim to experimentally investigate how species coexistence is impacted by plant resource use strategies (as summarized by functional traits) and species-specific interactions with soil microorganisms in an annual plant community in coastal California. A longstanding assumption has been that the coexistence of species with dissimilar functional traits is stabilized due to their distinct responses to environmental heterogeneity [@Adler_2013]. For Chapter 1 I plan to test this assumption using recent advances in coexistence theory that decompose the outcome of species interactions in patchy landscapes into coexistence-promoting stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that drive competitive exclusion [@Chesson_2000]. Specifically, I propose to test whether functional trait differences are predictive of the similarity in the functional responses of species to environmental gradients. Another striking observation from nature is that individuals within a species can have vastly different phenotypes. Despite considerable interest, the consequences of this variation on species coexistence remain largely unclear [@Violle_2012; @Turcotte_2016]. For Chapter 2, I aim to investigate how intra-specific variation in functional traits might influence community dynamics beginning from understanding of how trait differences influence species coexistence generally. Over the past two decades, a great deal of research has also highlighted the role of soil microorganisms in shaping terrestrial plant communities [@Bever_2015]. A key insight to emerge from this line of inquiry is that plant species coexistence can be promoted when plants cultivate a soil microbial community that has more negative impacts on plants of the same species than on plants of other species, which is in agreement with traditional coexistence theory [@Chesson_2000; @Bever_2003]. Although these biotic interactions influence plant community dynamcics in nature in conjunction with abiotic factors, their effects are generally considered independently of one another [@van_der_Putten_2016]. For Chapter 3, I aim to demonstrate how the relative contributions of plant-plant competition and plant-microbe interactions can be jointly considered under the established coexistence framework of @Chesson_2008 via a critical review of existing plant-soil feedback literature. This thesis will involve novel applications of recent advances in theoretical ecology to plant community and integrate the historically disjunct fields of plant competition and plant-microbe interactions.
